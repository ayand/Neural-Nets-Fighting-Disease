# Neural Nets Fighting Disease

The purpose of this project is to create neural nets to predict the occurrence of
various diseases. Each folder takes a disease dataset from Kaggle and tries to create
a neural net which can aptly classify that dataset.

## breast_cancer

### Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

This dataset focuses on predicting the nature of cancer tumors in breast cancer patients.
Benign instances are represented by diagnosis having a value of 0, and malignant
instances are represented by diagnosis having a value of 1. Running the neural net
yielded a training accuracy of 97.99%, and a test accuracy of 97.66%. The results of the run
can be seen in the folder
